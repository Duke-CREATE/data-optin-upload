# Duke Data Donation
A flask application allowing users to upload documents and have those be stored to a secure Azure database to be used for model finetuning and retrieval augmented generation at Duke University through the CREATE Lab.

The end goal is to build out Duke infrastructure to host our own LLM for use by all of the Duke community. The first step to this project is collecting data consentually from Duke personal and this interface allows us to do that effectively.
